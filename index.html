        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I am a current final year student of Olabisi Onabanjo University(OOU), Popularly known as ICHIE.
            I am naturally very ambitious especially if the ambition has "cheddah" written allover.
            I can be shy at times and at other times you'll be wowed but this strongly depends on the people i am with
            and the environment.
            I am also a life of the party but i don't attends parties neither do i go out (lol).
        </p>
        <p>I am enroute to being a full stack daveloper.
            I am currently learning how to be a frontend developer with the JUST PROJECTS COHORT 3.
            Asides from tech i also have a thing for farming both livestock and crops.
            I enjoy doing a couple of things like;
        <ul>
            <li>playing and watching football</li>
            <li>listening to music</li>
            <li>learning new things</li>
            <li>hanging out with friends</li>
            <li>eating good food</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
